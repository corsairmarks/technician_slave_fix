[h1]Overview[/h1]
Are your (non-domestic) slaves refusing to take Technician jobs?  This mod will get them back to work producing energy for their owners.

[h1]Changes[/h1]
As of Stellaris version 3.3 "Libra," this mod overrides [i]only[/i] the [b]technician[/b] job.  The only change to the job is to modify the weight condition for enslaved Pops (that are not domestic slaves).  The condition was incorrectly a [b]NOR[/b] which requires every condition to be false (in this case, four flavors of energy production traits) - which means that slaves [i]without[/i] energy-enhancing traits more strongly preferred being technicians.  This is the intuitively opposite of what should be happening.  To fix this inverted rule, the condition is changed to an [b]OR[/b] which correctly applies the bonus weight when an eligible Pop has any of the eligible traits.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
[b]If you use StarNet AI or StarTech AI, you do not need this mod.[/b]  In fact, it may undo custom job re-weighting in that mod for the [b]technician[/b] job.

Because this mod only overwrites the [b]technician[/b] job, it is compatible with practically any other Stellaris mod that doesn't make changes to the same job.

Built for Stellaris version 3.3 "Libra." Not compatible with achievements.le with achievements because it overwrites a core Stellaris file.

[h3]When to Install[/h3]
This mod can be safely added or removed from your savegame after the game has started.  It only alters one worker job to fix the weight.  If you remove it, your game will work normally.
